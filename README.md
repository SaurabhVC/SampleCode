# Dynamic code for search scenario from CRM implementation

Scenario : Search all records using input parameters.
This was a search RFC with multiple input parameters and all input parameters were optional.
Data was to be fetched from multiple CRM tables.
For performance optimization , only 1 query was to be fired.
So designed query was completely dyanamic .
